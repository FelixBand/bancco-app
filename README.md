# THIS IS A "VIRUS"!

Me and a friend have been experimenting with making a relatively harmless virus for Windows that blares loud sounds and generates funny pop-ups.

It does modify a bunch of registries and bluescreens after some time, so it's not recommended to run it.

# How does it work? What does it do?

The program is intended as a Trojan horse. It will act as if it's a different program and then perform its magic when run.

To run the virus, use `admin.bat`. This will open a UAC prompt and when "yes" is clicked the virus will run.
